It is with great pleasure that the Vega Strike Development Team announces the release of Vega Strike 0.7.0 and VS:Upon The Coldest Sea 0.7.0.
<!--more-->

Join our protagonist Deucalion in adventures around the universe as a bounty hunter, mercenary, or merchant flying through the
stars. Meet the deadly Aera and mysterious Rlaan. Battle with the Confederation. Run alongside Pirates. Or just buy and sell as a merchant while you
explore. The universe and adventure are yours.

## What's changed?

Since our last release last October of Vega Strike 0.6.0 we've done some refactors of the code as the new team has begun to understand
the code better. We've also added some helper scripts and a launcher icon for the Vega Strike Settings utility.

We have also disabled the networking code for the time being while we focus on the core engine. We intend to bring this back at a later
release after we've understood the core, single-player game better.

Like with 0.6.0, only Linux releases are available at this time. The Windows and Mac release of 0.5.1 are still available on [Source Forge][sf].
We do hope to bring back those releases, and having more team members on those platforms would help greatly in our ability to do so.

## Want to help out?

There's a lot to do. We're working diligently to update Vega Strike. Version 0.7.0 is our next step along the lines and is preparing us for moving
off of Python 2 and onto Python 3. We've already got several releases planned in the process of continuing to update our dependencies and fix bugs;
you can see our [Road Map][roadmap]. We need everything from coding, story development, art work, documentation, and even just generally helping the community.

The development team is active at [Gitter.im][gitter] and we'd love to hear from you.

You can also find the community at the [Vega Strike Forums][forums].

## Where can I find the release?

[Vega Strike Engine 0.7.0][vse]
[Vega Strike: Upon the Coldest Sea 0.7.0][vsutcs]

NOTE: Presently just the Linux builds are provided. The Vega Strike Team is still working to restore Mac and Windows support.
