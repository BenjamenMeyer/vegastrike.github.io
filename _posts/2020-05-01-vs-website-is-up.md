The new Vega Strike website is up and running. Now we just need to add some content to it, to make
it relevant.

Vega Strike is coming back to life. Feel free to download the latest code from [Github][vs-gh]. If
you find any issues, just [file a ticket][vs-issues] or [open a pull request][vs-pr].
You're always welcome to jump to our [Gitter][vs-gitter] channel to chat with the rest of the community.

Hope to see around, and don't break your hull!

NaBaCo.
