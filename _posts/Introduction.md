Hello to all of our past and present users I'm **loki1950** aka Denis Belanger been with the project for 14 years now.
And have been the forums administer for the last decade where I took the title "The Shepard" well a few weeks ago
I was designated Project Lead by our current crew of developers so now that title I took is more apt in that I now 
Shepard the whole project not just the forums.


    Now a bit of biography that 1950 in my username is the year I was born so I'm an old geek actually wrote my first code
back in the sixties in a precursor of FORTRAN called FORTE my college years added Assembly language on a couple of then 
current platforms IBM 360 DOS and the Digital PDP-8e after college worked for stained glass start up where I helped verify our melting tank design and designing a digital control system for our process this is was during the 8 bit era with an Ohio Scientific C1P 6502 cpu BASIC in ROM M$ BASIC 1977 basic was useless for us so I implemented fig FORTH on it for real time control sill have that little beast part of my settlement when we went bust not enough capital.


    Now for current times we will be going forward on our road map as fast as we can feel free to comment on our forms and gitter I believe we need to rebuild our community to become a viable project again so this an invitation for new users when we do get a binary out the door.
